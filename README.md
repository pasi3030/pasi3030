Hello Github. My name is Patryk Si≈Çkowski and I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering specialized in Power Electronics. I have spent the last eight years working in embedded software engineering. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects, from developing smart home node devices and gateways. wearables - protective helmet and Vehicle Computing Platform for automotive industry.
